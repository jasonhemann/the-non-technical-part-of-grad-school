* Notes

From a talk on the completing the non-technical part of grad school
for phd students in computer science. This was from a talk at the
[[https://wonks.github.io/]PL-Wonks at IU], but it should be pretty
generally applicable.

* Surprise! 

It might surprise you to learn:

  - your goal is *not* to become a researcher
  - your goal is *not* to get a PhD
  - your goal (likely) is to get a tenure-track position at a school of your choice and location.

These are *not* the same thing! This is something you prepare for
during the entirety of graduate school. If you haven't been actively
focusing on the latter, as opposed to the former, you're late. Do you
know:

   - What goes into a diversity statement?

   - How do you re-tool your CV for faculty positions at different types of
     schools, or a post-doc?

   - Avoiding platitudes that everyone says, what is your teaching
     philosophy -- say, elaborated in 1-2 pages of prose?

   - How do I do all of this while writing up my dissertation, while
     putting out research, while building a record of receiving grants?

* You're late

Are you keeping your CV up-to-date(-ish)?
It's easy to do at the moment, just write it in a comment in the tex file,
tougher to reconstruct later!

In addition to the things you're regularly considering, your future
employers are also looking for:

  - A record of receiving grants
  - A record of service 

What have you been doing on these fronts? 

** Go to the GradGrants Center:
Either make an appointment with the
[[http://www.indiana.edu/~gradgrnt/][Grad Grants Center]], or just
walk in. Their _job_ is to help convince people to give you money,
often money that goes _unclaimed_!

  - Nothing wrong with trying for /small/ grants. Do it for a
    project. It'll help you frame your research. It's an exercise good
    for more than the money.
  - Travel Grants. In a pinch, these count!

** Building a Service record

  - Reviewing journal/conference submissions?
  - Graduate student government sorts of things
  - Promoting diversity in STEM on campus 
  - Volunteering at conferences? (there's $ in it!) 
  - Undergraduate mentoring (there's $ for it!)
  - Summer programs e.g. [[http://indiana.edu/~fsm][FSM]]  (there's $ in it!) 

There's often immediate benefits as well as long-term benefits, and
it's not nearly as time-consuming as you'd fear.

** The Vita 
  The CV is important, and you do want to have been keeping it up to
  date. The career services folk are there and useful, but they're
  typically more used to putting together. Still useful. SOIC has its
  own Career Services, they're eager and available to meet. Use in
  conjunction w/CITL.


** CITL

These people are invaluable. I can't speak highly enough of them. They
are experts in academic hiring the way we are experts in programming
languages. It would be _silly_ to not take advantage of that. 

If you are:
  - [[https://wts.indiana.edu/graduate-students/journal-article-writing-groups.html][Submitting to a conference]]
  - [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepFiLoZQBh-KrtoVhx7VBlz5N0CiRi2s9rqh87ZwmxnbyQPQ/viewform][Writing your dissertation]]
  - [[https://wts.indiana.edu/graduate-students/workshops-for-graduate-students.html][Building your portfolio]]

or anything of the sort, you should be taking advantage of their
resources. If you are in what you expect to be your last 2 years of
graduate school, you _need_ to be hitting these folk up. 

There are
[[https://tockify.com/gmc.events/detail/296/1515623400000][other
writing groups]] on campus, and if none of those work, build your own!

* The mechanics of job searching
 People start posting in August. You would like to be the first one in
 the door. Notice also that you might want to try twice.

    setups, sign up for a dis. writing group. Just get there. Their
    utility will make itself manifestly clear.
